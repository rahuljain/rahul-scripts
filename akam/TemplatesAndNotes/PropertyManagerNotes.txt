This hostname is used for the DNS lookup when going forward, the value of the Host header in the forward request, and the cache key of objects retrieved.

This separator specifies the domain name to use as the DNS lookup when the Akamai server goes forward to the origin server. 
The Akamai server will use the domain name specified in this tag when it goes forward to fetch content, but it does not change the Host header sent to the origin server, and does not change the origin server value used in the cache key (that value is taken from forward:origin-server.host)
